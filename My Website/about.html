            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>I made this website in hopes of showing the limitless potential of my talent so that potential employers can see what I can do. I have long struggled in finding a career, so I wish for this to help me.</p>
            <p>I started my job search around three years ago, but only managed to get a small position working in a small kitchen at an American Legion location. I wanted more, a better job where I could really show off my talent. No matter how many applications I put in, either people wouldn't accept me or I couldn't figure out ways to get to the new job. To this day, I still don't have one. My career has not started yet.</p>
            <p>In showing you this portfolio, I hope I can convince you to give me a chance to prove myself, as I did all of this from scratch.</p>
